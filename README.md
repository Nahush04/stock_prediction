# Data Project - Stock Market Analysis 

![sum](https://github.com/Nahush04/Real-time-emotion-detection/blob/main/images/model%20descrip.png)

In this notebook we will be looking at data from the stock market, particularly some technology stocks. We will learn how to use pandas to get stock information, visualize different aspects of it, and finally we will look at a few ways of analyzing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history. We will also be predicting future stock prices through a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) method!
LSTMs are widely used for sequence prediction problems and have proven to be extremely effective. The reason they work so well is that LSTM can store past important information and forget the information that is not.
LSTM has three gates:
The input gate: The input gate adds information to the cell state,
The forget gate: It removes the information that is no longer required by the model,
The output gate: Output Gate at LSTM selects the information to be shown as output.

We'll be answering the following questions along the way:

    1.) What was the change in price of the stock over time?
    2.) What was the daily return of the stock on average?
    3.) What was the moving average of the various stocks?
    4.) What was the correlation between different stocks'?
    5.) How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?
    6.) How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior? (Predicting the closing price stock price of Microsoft inc using LSTM)
